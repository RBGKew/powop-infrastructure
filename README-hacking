This document holds information for those that have received these
sources via revision control rather than a packaged release.

It is assumed the developer has initialised the submodules inside the
repository, either via `--recurse-submodules' during a clone or via
the `submodule' command:

        git submodule init
        git submodule update

This is because sensitive information is held separately and included
here under the `secrets' directory.  You will need access to this
repository separately; contact the package maintainer.
