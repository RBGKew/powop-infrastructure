This document contains details related to working on source from the
perspective of the maintainer.

When working on or with the Helm charts at the Royal Botanic Gardens,
Kew access to the existing Kubernetes cluster(s) on Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) is required.  The console can be found at the location
below.

        https://console.cloud.google.com/

As the maintainer, the expectation is that control over a pair of
clusters, `powo-dev' and `powo-prod', was provided during the passing
of the torch.  If this is not the case, at least one of the developers
should be able ensure you are given the correct permissions.  See the
usual files and logs for their details.

When attempting to deploy, it is necessary for work to be externally
available.  Given permission to push to the blessed repositories then
it is possible to push to them simultaneously.

        git remote add upstream $internal
        for remote in $internal $external
        do
          git remote set-url --add --push upstream $remote
        done

Only the trunk should be shared; a remote of this form should not be
used to share topic branches.
